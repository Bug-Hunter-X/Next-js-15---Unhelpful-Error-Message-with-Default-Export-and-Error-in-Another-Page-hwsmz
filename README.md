# Next.js 15 - Unhelpful Error Message with Default Export and Error in Another Page

This repository demonstrates a confusing error that occurs in Next.js 15 when a default export is used in a page, and there's an error in another page. The error message from Next.js is not very informative, making debugging difficult.

## The Bug

The `pages/about.js` file throws an error. When you navigate to the `/` route (which uses default export in `pages/index.js`), Next.js will throw a generic error, which doesn't pinpoint the actual source of the problem in `pages/about.js`.  The error is difficult to debug because the error message does not indicate that the problem originates from `pages/about.js`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will observe a generic error message.

## Solution

While the original error isn't easily debugged, a better error handling strategy can improve the situation.  Consider using error boundaries, improving logging, or better use of Next.js's error handling features.
